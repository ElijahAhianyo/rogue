Forked from s0lst1c3's [eaphammer](https://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer) project, Rogue is an extensible toolkit aimed at providing penetration testers an easy-to-use platform to deploy software-defined Access Points (AP) for the purpose of conducting wireless penetration testing and red team engagements. By using Rogue, penetration testers can easily perform targeted evil twin attacks against a variety of wireless network types.
